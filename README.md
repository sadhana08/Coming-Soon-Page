# Frontend Mentor - Ping coming soon page

![Design preview for the Ping coming soon page coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out my solution.


**Challenge done using, HTML, CSS and JavaScript (Basic).**

## The challenge

Challenge is to build out this Coming Soon page and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

Your will be able to: 

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for button elements on the page
- Submit their email address using an `input` field
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
	- The `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say *"Whoops! It looks like you forgot to add your email"*
	- The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say *"Please provide a valid email address"*


## Got feedback for the solution?

I'd love receiving feedback! I'm always looking to improve my coding practice. So if you have anything you'd like to mention, please email kunnathsadhana2611@gmail.com.


**THANKS!** ðŸš€
